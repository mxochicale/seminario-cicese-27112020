\textbf{Take away messages}
\begin{itemize}
\item Nonlinear analysis tools can quantify different
data time-series. 
\item Shannon entropy with 3D plot surfaces of RQA appear to be robust for real-word data (i.e. different time series
structures, window length size and levels of smoothness).
\item Therefore, Shannon entropy would be a potential good tool to quantify complexity of movement.
%\item Smoothing raw time series can create well defined trajectories
%or patterns in RSS or RP, however such increase of smoothness 
%can also create more complex (i.e. not well defined) trajectories
%or patterns in nonlinear analysis. 

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Investigate}
\begin{itemize}
	\item other methodologies for state space reconstruction,
	\item the robustness of Entropy measurements with RQA, and 
	\item variability in perception of velocity.
\end{itemize}
