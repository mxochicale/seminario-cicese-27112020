## Abstract:
In this talk I will speak about (a) theoretical models for human
movement variability and methods to quantify human movement
variability, (b) use of nonlinear methods to measure real-world time
series data (i.e., data affected by non-stationarity, non-linearity,
data length, sensor source, noise, etc.), and (c) illustration of
results for real-world time-series data from human-robot imitation
activities. I will then comment on current and future challenges on
this subject and how the above points might lead to develop tools
to evaluate, for instance, the improvement of movement performances,
to quantify and provide feedback of skill learning or to quantify
movement adaptations and pathologies.
Similarly, I will speak about my current role in a multidisciplinary project
in the context of Ultrasound-Guidance Procedures where I am jumping
between the areas of medical imaging, AI, physics and robotics .

## Short Bio:
Miguel Xochicale is currently a Research Associate at King's College
London within the School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging
Sciences where he is pushing forward the state-of-the-art of
ultrasound-guidance procedures and is making scientific contributions to
new algorithms, software and hardware. Prior to that, he was awarded a
Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Birmingham (UoB)
in July 2019 where he investigated Nonlinear Analysis to Quantify
Movement Variability in Human-Humanoid Interaction and published the
first open-accessed and reproducible PhD thesis since the
establishment of UoB in 1900.
Miguel has 20 years’ experience in human-robot interaction,
electronics, mechatronics and signal processing, along with 12 years’
experience as a teaching associate in Mechatronic and Computer
Engineering. He has passion for Open Science meaning that he
open-sourced all his contributions to knowledge in GitHub. He also
tweets and re-tweets about Robotics, Chaos, AI and Brains @_mxochicale
